<h1>Notes on learning French</h1>

<p>
  Like many people, I was taught the basics of French in high school and
  then later found that I still had a lot to learn as my needs became more
  demanding: from passing exams in a non-francophone country, to basic
  interactions in France, to working, socialising, and studying often
  completely in French.
  My French is much improved, though I am still frustrated that I do not
  always understand completely, and that I cannot always express myself as
  adequately as I would like.
  Since people sometimes ask me for pointers on learning French, I
  have written these notes on the ideas and resources that I find most
  useful.
  These notes are
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>subjective</em>—they are about what worked for me, but they will
    not be optimal for everybody;</li>

  <li>for <em>intermediate</em> learners—I was taught the basics of French
    by competent teachers, these notes are about how I worked, and continue
    to work, to improve myself;</li>

  <li><em>not rigorous</em>—I have no formal training in language teaching, I
    did not keep references for the meta-theory, and I give opinions based on
    a single data point (me!); and</li>

  <li>sometimes <em>anglophone specific</em>—several of the resources are
  for English speakers learning French.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The approach I describe is based on <em>spaced repetition</em>,
  mostly online resources, one or two technical
  books, and the principles: (<em>a</em>) theory guides but never replaces
  practice, and (<em>b</em>) the skills of listening, reading, speaking,
  and writing required separate but coordinated efforts. The approach
  aims at eventual mastery of the language, that is, for precision, range,
  and nuance in comprehension and production, rather than for minimum
  working knowledge.
  Objections and suggestions are always <a href="tim@tbrk.org">welcome</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The first six sections of the notes reflect the structure I chose for my
  studies. The last section reflects on what I wished I had avoided or
  done differently.

<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary and spaced repetition</h2>

<p>
  Every language student must learn to associate thousands of
  words—essentially arbitrary graphical and phonetic forms—with their
  meanings.
  <em>Spaced repetition</em> is a powerful technique for memorising
  thousands of words efficiently.
  Basically, you start by creating or downloading a set of virtual
  ‘flashcards’ for the vocabulary that you want to learn.
  Cards have two sides: one for the foreign word to learn, and the other for
  its meaning(s), usually in your native language.
  You then regularly quiz yourself with a computer program that
  successively presents you with one side of a card, and you try
  to recall the other side before it is shown to you.
  Upon seeing the correct answer, you grade your performance in a range from
  ‘completely forgotten’ to ‘too easy’.
  The program uses your responses to decide when next to quiz you on
  each given card: those you forget are shown more and more often, and
  those you remember are shown less and less often.
</p>

<!-- TODO: include a screenshot of a card from Mnemosyne -->

<p>
  The basic idea is simple and it works remarkably well because
</p>

<ol>
  <li>it is based on studies of human memory 
    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">the spacing
      effect</a>);</li>

  <li>the daily reviews quickly become a habit and ensure that you
    spend some time revising each day;</li>

  <li>the algorithm is very efficient, you can have a database of tens of
    thousands of cards but review only tens each day (for instance,
    I have amassed 24 000 cards over seven years and I need only review
    between 100 and 150 a day).</li>
</ol>

<p>This
  <a href="http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all">Wired
    article</a> is a very nice introduction to spaced repetition and the work
  and ideas of Piotr Wozniak who developed the modern, computer-based
  <a href="http://www.supermemo.com">SuperMemo</a> algorithm—compared to
  the earlier
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimsleur_method">Pimsleur
    graduated interval</a> and
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner</a> systems.
  Several spaced repetition programs now exist. The main ones are
  <a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a> and
  <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>.
  Both are free software. I use Mnemosyne but Anki is more popular.
  Both applications have the following essential characteristics:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>efficient editing of flashcards with colours, fonts, images, sounds,
    and special characters (like those of the <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr>),</li>

  <li>a simple interface that helps you focus on real learning and avoid
    procrastinating on a computer, and</li>

  <li>simple and solid support for reviewing cards on a mobile phone (gimmicky
    animations and a multitude of buttons and menus may seem fun at first, but
    ultimately become obstacles to, and distractions from efficient
    learning).</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Support for mobile review is almost a critical feature. It allows you to
  employ time spent on public transport or waiting in queues to
  do your daily language study.
  Since the study is already broken into small pieces (individual cards), it
  does not matter that your study is interrupted or spread out over several
  sessions; it may even be
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?_r=0">beneficial</a>.
  I developed <a href="../software/mnemojojo.html">Mnemojojo</a> and
  <a href="../software/mnemododo.html">Mnemododo</a> for reviewing Mnemosyne
  cards on mobile phones.
  Many people seem happy with

<h3>Choosing vocabulary</h3>

<p>
  Spaced repetition is a powerful tool for organizing and learning words, but
  which words should you learn?
  The question is an important one since there are potentially
  <a href="http://academie-francaise.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#56_strong-em-nombre-de-mots-de-la-langue-franaise-em-strong">very many words</a> to learn and most of us
  have limited capacity and time.
  One approach would be to create or download cards for the 1000 to 3000 most
  frequently used nouns and verbs.
  This ideas seems rational,<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup> but I did not try it,
  since I already had a
  rudimentary vocabulary, so I cannot comment on how well it works.
  Instead, the approach I take is to
  systematically note and add words as I come across them when
  reading or listening, or when I fail to express myself for lack of the
  right word.
  For instance, I underline words in newspaper articles, make lists as
  I read novels or listen to people speaking, and regularly search for
  translations of the English words, expressions, and constructions that
  I need.
  There are two main advantages to creating a list manually in this way, as
  opposed to downloading someone else's ready-made list.
  First, the resulting vocabulary is aligned with one's interests, needs,
  and milieu.
  Second, by copying words onto lists, looking them up online, and then
  adapting material into a flashcard, you are already paying attention
  to the words and familiarising yourself with their shapes and meanings.
  In your own private lists you can copy-and-paste definitions and examples
  directly from dictionaries, and use images and sounds from websites, without
  having to worry about crediting the authors or respecting copyright.
</p>

<p>
  I regularly use the following sources to translate words for my flashcards:

<h3>Creating cards</h3>

<p>
  Wozniak gives <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20
  rules</a> for formulating cards for spaced repetition learning.

</p>

<!-- TODO:
     * use images for nouns and include articles and example sentences!
     * learn forward and reverse mappings.
     * use sentences for verbs and vary the subjects and tense.
     * include phonetic transcriptions and sound recordings (see below).

     * Tips on making cards (main reference to Wozniak).
   -->

<h2 id="grammar">Grammar: patterns and theory</h2>

<!-- TODO: the problem is to absorb the patterns of language for precise
     and smooth communication. -->
<!-- TODO: Grammar is useful as a formal model of a complex system. It
     should not be seen as prescriptive (as rules that must be followed),
     but rather as a tool for discovering, understanding, and learning
     the patterns of real language.
     It can speedup the discovery of patterns (in a sense, you only perceive
     what you are trained to notice) and help in generalizing and adapting
     known sentences to new situations.

<!-- TODO: start with detective novels, move on to... -->
<!-- TODO: influence of material on vocabularly learnt.

     * Do not interrupt reading to translate (unless absolutely necessary)
       Instead note the unknown words (by underlining or on a separate piece
       of paper) and look them up later.
     
     -->

<h2 id="writing">Writing (written production)</h2>

<!-- TODO: feedback from others. antidote checker. write emails -->

<h2 id="didnotwork">What didn't work?</h2>

<!-- TODO:
     * books of exercises
     * learning tables of conjugaisons in isolation.
     * learning verbs in isolation of sentences.

    Advice to a younger me:
    * You will not learn French by buying many books (you must read them!).
